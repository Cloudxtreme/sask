# Task 2 of the second phase of project

#### To the already framed questions in task 1, create SPARQL queries for each of them and load the OKE data into the triple store (Fuseki server).

Write a small piece of Java code which you can get in the [link 1](https://jena.apache.org/tutorials/rdf_api.html#ch-Reading%20RDF) and [link 2](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/app_api.html) and create your SPARQL queries for each question.

Let's consider the example for the question which was described in the task 1 i.e., "Who is the trainer of Conor McGregor?"

As you remember, this question was taken from the response data (refer task 1 if needed for explanantion) where "dbo:trainer dbr:Conor_McGregor"

You can take a look at the code which is there by name SparqlQuery.java.

Using the mentioned code above, frame the SPARQL queries for each of the 50 questions which you created from the dataset.
