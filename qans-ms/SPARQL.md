# Generation of SPARQL queries

Data on the Web has been increasing greatly at a constant rate. The mere amount of data that needs to be queried poses an important challenge. For end users it's indeed a difficult task, to find the information on the web they are looking for. We have services such as _Sindice_, _Sig.ma_, _Swoogle_ or _Watson_ that offer simple search services. But they are restricted either to the retrieval of single RDF document or the retrieval of information about a single entity from different sources as in case of _Sig.ma_. 

## What is SPARQL?
SPARQL is the standard language to query RDF data (Triple format).

**SPARQL** stands for **S**PARQL **P**rotocol and **R**DF **Q**uery **L**anguage.
