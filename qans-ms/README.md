# Resource Description Framework

## _**RDF**_ is a data model for describing "things" (web resources) and their interrelations.

* Resources are decribed in terms of properties and property values using RDF statements.

* Statements in RDF are _**Triples**_ consisting of *subject*, *predicate* and *object*.

     For example: Alia is a girl.

                 Subject : Alia, Predicate : is a, Object : girl
                 
* Subject and predicate could be URIs whereas object could be URIs or literals.

* Triples are usually graphs.

* Subjects and objects are represented by nodes whereas predicates by links or edges.

* _**Uniform Resource Identifier**_ (URI) - string of characters used to identify a name or a resource on the internet. 

* Common _**Serialization Formats**_ are:

                    Turtle
                    N-Triples
                    N-Quads    
                    N3/Notation3      
                    JSON-LD
                    RDF/XML
                    RDF/JSON
