Steps to install:

Maven Build:

mvn clean package
mvn clean spring-boot:run

Limitations:
1. HAWK doesnt work as of now. So less chances of getting responses.
2. UI displays text as is. Need to make it user readable.
3. JQUERY.js is present with the UI code. Need to make it dependant on Maven and shared with extraction team.
4. Others.
